'''Routing and Remote Access Service''' ('''RRAS''') is a Microsoft [[API]] and [[Server (computing)|server]] software that makes it possible to create applications to administer the [[Router (computing)|routing]] and remote access service capabilities of the [[operating system]], to function as a network router. Developers can also use RRAS to implement routing protocols. The RRAS server functionality follows and builds upon the [[Remote Access Service]] (RAS) in [[Windows NT 4.0]].<ref name="RRAS MSDN Library">[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Aa446768 RRAS MSDN Library]</ref> RRAS was introduced with Windows 2000 and offered as a download for Windows NT 4.0.

* Multiprotocol [[Router (computing)|router]] - The computer running RRAS can route [[Internet Protocol|IP]], [[IPX]], and [[AppleTalk]] simultaneously.  All routable protocols are configured from the same administrative utility. RRAS included two [[unicast]] routing protocols, [[Routing Information Protocol]] (RIP) and [[Open Shortest Path First]] (OSPF) as well as [[Internet Group Management Protocol|IGMP]] routing and forwarding features for [[IP multicast]]ing.
* [[Dial-on-demand routing|Demand-dial router]] - IP and IPX can be routed over on-demand or persistent [[Wide area network|WAN]] links such as analog phone lines or [[ISDN]], or over [[VPN]] connections.
* [[Remote Access Server|Remote access server]] - provides remote access connectivity to dial-up or VPN remote access clients that use IP, IPX, AppleTalk, or [[NetBEUI]].

Routing services and remote access services used to work separately.  [[Point-to-Point Protocol]] (PPP), the protocol suite commonly used to negotiate point-to-point connections, has allowed them to be combined.

RRAS can be used to create [[Client (computing)|client]] applications. These applications display RAS common [[dialog box]]es, manage remote access connections and devices, and manipulate phone-book entries.<ref name="RRAS Microsoft MSDN">[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb545679(v=vs.85).aspx Routing and Remote Access Service MSDN]</ref>

==Routing and Remote Access Service Management Pack==
The Routing and Remote Access Service Management Pack helps a network administrator monitor the status and availability of computers running Windows Server 2008 R2.<ref name="RRAS Mgmt Pack Guide">[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=785e5524-6228-45a9-b3e7-d85e48345a34&displaylang=e RRAS Management Pack Guide for System Center Operations Manager 2007]</ref>

==Features introduced in Windows Server 2008==
*Server Manager - Application used to assist system administrators with installation, configuration, and management of other RRAS features.
*[[Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol]]
*VPN enforcement for [[Network Access Protection]] - Limits VPN connections to defined network services.
*[[IPv6]] support - added [[Point-to-Point Protocol|PPPv6]], [[L2TP]], [[DHCPv6]], and [[RADIUS]] technologies allowing them to work over IPv6.
*New [[cryptographic]] support - strengthened [[encryption]] algorithms to comply with U.S. government security requirements, in addition to removing algorithms which could not be strengthened.<ref name="Whats New">[https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc730711(WS.10).aspx#BKMK_3 What's New in Routing and Remote Access in Windows Server 2008]</ref>

==Removed technologies==
*[[Bandwidth Allocation Protocol]] (BAP) was removed from [[Windows Vista]], and disabled in [[Windows Server 2008]].
*[[X.25]].
*[[Serial Line Internet Protocol]] (SLIP). SLIP-based connections will automatically be updated to PPP-based connections.
*[[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM)

*[[NWLink]] [[IPX/SPX]]/[[NetBIOS]] Compatible Transport Protocol
*Services for Macintosh
*[[Open Shortest Path First]] (OSPF) routing protocol component in Routing and Remote Access
*Basic Firewall in RRAS (replaced with [[Windows Firewall]])
*Static IP filter APIs for RRAS (replaced with [[Windows Filtering Platform]] APIs)
*The [[Password authentication protocol|SPAP]], [[Extensible Authentication Protocol|EAP-MD5-CHAP]], and [[MS-CHAP]] authentication protocols for PPP-based connections.<ref name="Whats New" />
