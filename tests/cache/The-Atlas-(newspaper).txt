distinguished itself from its rivals both by the size of paper it used (it boasted of being printed on "the largest sheet ever issued from the press") and by its price (one [[Shilling (British coin)|shilling]], almost double that of comparable journals).<ref name="brake"/>  The price was gradually reduced (10 [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|

Manchester-based [[Temperance movement|
pro-temperance]] organization.<ref name="brake"/>  The title was changed to ''The Englishman'' between 1862 and 1865, before reverting to ''The Atlas''.  During 1869, the final year of its operation, its name changed to ''The Atlas and Public Schools Chronicle'' and finally ''The Public Schools Chronicle'' for the remainder of that year.<ref name="brake"/>
