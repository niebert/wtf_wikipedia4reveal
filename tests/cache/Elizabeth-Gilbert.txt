'''Elizabeth M. Gilbert''' (born July 18, 1969) is an American author, [[essayist]], short story writer, biographer, novelist, and [[memoirist]]. She is best known for her 2006 memoir, ''[[Eat, Pray, Love]]'', which as of December 2010 had spent 199 weeks on the ''[[New York Times Best Seller list]]'', and which was also made into a [[Eat Pray Love|film]] by the same name in 2010.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/28/books/bestseller/bestpapernonfiction.html?_r=1 |work=The New York Times |title=Paperback Nonfiction |date=2010-02-28 |accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref>

==Early life==
Gilbert was born in [[Waterbury, Connecticut]]. Her father was a chemical engineer; her mother a housewife. She is of [[Swedes|Swedish]] descent.<ref>http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/10/02/elizabeth-gilbert-how-i-write.html</ref> Along with her only sister, novelist [[Catherine Gilbert Murdock]], Gilbert grew up on a small family [[Christmas tree]] farm in [[Litchfield, Connecticut]]. The family lived in the country with no neighbors; they did not own a television or record player. Consequently, the family read a great deal, and Gilbert and her sister entertained themselves by writing books and plays.<ref>{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Elizabeth Gilbert, Zacharis Award |url=http://www.pshares.org/issues/article.cfm?prmarticleID=4813 |format= |doi= |accessdate=2008-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103173614/http://www.pshares.org/issues/article.cfm?prmarticleID=4813 |archivedate=January 3, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Lucky me |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/10/elizabeth-gilbert-books-interview-family |publisher=The Guardian |date=January 10, 2009 |accessdate=February 4, 2013}}</ref>

Gilbert earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[political science]] from [[New York University]] in 1991, after which she worked as a cook, a bartender, a waitress, and a magazine employee.<ref name=":0" /> She wrote of her experience as a cook on a [[dude ranch]] in short stories, and also briefly in her book ''The Last American Man'' (Viking 2002).

==Career==

===Journalism===
''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' published Gilbert's short story "Pilgrims" in 1993, under the headline "The Debut of an American Writer". She was the first unpublished short story writer to debut in ''Esquire'' since [[Norman Mailer]]. This led to steady work as a journalist for a variety of national magazines, including ''[[Spin (magazine)|SPIN]]'', ''[[GQ]]'', ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', ''[[Allure (magazine)|Allure]]'', ''[[Real Simple]]'', and ''[[Travel + Leisure]]''. As stated in the memoir ''Eat, Pray, Love'', Gilbert made a career as a highly paid freelance writer.

Her 1997 ''GQ'' article, "The Muse of the [[Coyote Ugly Saloon]]", a   memoir of Gilbert's time as a bartender at the very first [[Coyote Ugly Saloon|Coyote Ugly]] [[Table dance|table dancing bar]] located in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] section of [[New York City]],<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=http://www.gq.com/news-politics/newsmakers/199703/elizabeth-gilbert-gq-march-1997-muse-coyote-ugly-saloon|title=The Muse of the Coyote Ugly Saloon|date=March 1997|publisher=GQ|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}</ref> was the basis for the feature film ''[[Coyote Ugly (film)|Coyote Ugly]]'' (2000). She adapted her 1998 ''GQ'' article, "The Last American Man", into a biography of the modern woodsman and naturalist in ''The Last American Man''.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Last American Man |url=http://www.gq.com/news-politics/mens-lives/199802/elizabeth-gilbert-gq-february-1998-last-american-man-eustace-conway-turtle-island |date=February 1998 |publisher=GQ |accessdate=February 4, 2013}}</ref> "The Ghost", a profile of [[Hank Williams III]] published by ''GQ'' in 2000, was included in ''Best American Magazine Writing 2001''.

===Books===
Gilbert's first book, ''[[Pilgrims (short story collection)|Pilgrims]]'' (Houghton Mifflin 1997), a collection of short stories, received the [[Pushcart Prize]] and was a finalist for the [[PEN/Hemingway Award]]. This was followed by her novel ''Stern Men'' (Houghton Mifflin 2000), selected by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as a "Notable Book." In 2002, she published ''The Last American Man'' (2002), which was nominated for [[National Book Award]] in non-fiction.

==== ''Eat, Pray, Love'' ====
In 2006, Gilbert published ''[[Eat, Pray, Love]]: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia'' (Viking, 2006), a chronicle of her year of "spiritual and personal exploration" spent traveling abroad.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bluerectangle.com/book_reviews/view_one_review/2261 |title=''Eat, Pray, Love'' (review) |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=2011-10-24}}</ref> She financed her world travel for the book with a $200,000 publisher's advance after pitching the concept in a book proposal. The best-seller has been critiqued by some writers as "priv-lit"<ref>http://bitchmagazine.org/article/eat-pray-spend</ref> and a "calculated business decision."<ref>http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2013/10/18/the-elizabeth-gilbert-problem</ref> The memoir was on the [[New York Times Best Seller List|''New York Times'' Best Seller List]] of non-fiction in the spring of 2006, and in October 2008, after 88 weeks, the book was still on the list at number 2.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/12/books/bestseller/bestpapernonfiction.html?_r=1&scp=5&sq=Eat,%20Pray,%20Love&st=cse&oref=slogin Paperback Nonfiction] ''New York Times'', October 3, 2008.</ref> Gilbert appeared on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' in 2007, and has reappeared on the show to further discuss the book and her philosophy, and to discuss the film.<ref>[http://www.oprah.com/dated/oprahshow/oprahshow_20071204 Why We Can't Stop Talking About Eat, Pray, Love!] ''The Oprah Winfrey Show''.</ref> She was named amongst [[Time 100]] most influential people in the world by ''[[TIME]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 2008 TIME 100: Artists & Entertainers:Elizabeth Gilbert |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1733748_1733752_1735978,00.html |date=April 30, 2009 |publisher=TIME |accessdate=February 4, 2013}}</ref> The book was optioned for a [[film]] by [[Columbia Pictures]], which was released as ''[[Eat Pray Love]]'' on August 13, 2010, with [[Julia Roberts]] starring as Gilbert.<ref>{{IMDb name|2418691}}</ref>

==== ''Big Magic'' ====
Gilbert's fifth book, ''[[Committed: A Skeptic Makes Peace with Marriage]]'', was released by [[Viking Press]] in January 2010. The book is somewhat of a sequel to ''Eat, Pray, Love'' in that it takes up Gilbert's life story where her bestseller left off. ''Committed'' also reveals Gilbert's decision to marry Jose Nunes (referred to in the book as Felipe), a Brazilian man she met in Indonesia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/01/11/100111crbo_books_levy|title=Hitched: In her new memoir, Elizabeth Gilbert gets married.|date=|publisher=The New Yorker|author=Ariel Levi|work=|accessdate=2011-10-24}}</ref> The book is an examination of the institution of marriage from several historical and modern perspectives—including those of people, particularly women, reluctant to marry. In the book, Gilbert also includes perspectives on [[same-sex marriage]] and compares this to interracial marriage prior to the 1970s.

In 2012, she republished ''At Home on the Range,'' a 1947 cookbook written by her great-grandmother, the food columnist Margaret Yardley Potter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gq.com/entertainment/books/201205/elizabeth-gilbert-interview-home-on-the-range-eat-pray-love|title=Elizabeth Gilbert Serves Up a New Classic|date=May 24, 2012|publisher=GQ|author=Michael Hainey|accessdate=February 4, 2013}}</ref> Gilbert published her second novel, ''The Signature of All Things'', in 2013.

In 2015, Gilbert published ''Big Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear'', a self-help book that provides instructions on how to live a life as creative as hers.<ref>Paskin, Willa [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/books/review/elizabeth-gilberts-big-magic.html Elizabeth Gilbert’s ‘Big Magic’] ''New York Times''.

January 4, 2016</ref> Gilbert continued the work started in ''Big Magic'' with her ''Magic Lessons'' podcast in which she interviews famous creatives including Brene Brown and Sarah Jones.

A review of ''Big Magic'' in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' stated that most of the advice in the book is matter-of-fact, but that, "Gilbert comes bearing reports from a new world where untold splendors lie waiting for those bold and hard-working enough to claim them. What’s unclear is how many could successfully follow on her trail."<ref>Fischer, Molly [http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2015/10/elizabeth_gilbert_s_big_magic_creative_living_beyond_fear_reviewed.single.html Charm Machine] ''Slate''.

===Literary influences===
In an interview, Gilbert mentioned ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]'' with nostalgia, adding, "I am a writer today because I learned to love reading as a child—and mostly on account of the [[List of Oz books|Oz books]]..." She has said she was particularly influenced by [[Charles Dickens]], and has noted this in many interviews. She identifies [[Marcus Aurelius]]'s ''[[Meditations]]'' as her favorite book on philosophy.<ref>[http://infloox.wordpress.com/2010/02/23/elizabeth-gilbert-on-her-favourite-books/ "Elizabeth Gilbert's literary influences"], Infloox blog, 23 February 2010</ref>  She also declared [[Jack Gilbert]] as "the poet laureate of my life" when she succeeded him as a writer-in-residence at the [[University of Tennessee]] in 2006.<ref>{{cite news |last=Fassler|first=Joe|date= 2012-11-06

==Personal life==
In a 2015 article for ''[[The New York Times]]'' titled “Confessions of a Seduction Addict,” Gilbert wrote that she “careened from one intimate entanglement to the next—dozens of them—without so much as a day off between romances.” She acknowledged, “Seduction was never a casual sport for me; it was more like a heist, adrenalizing and urgent. I would plan the heist for months, scouting out the target, looking for unguarded entries. Then I would break into his deepest vault, steal all his emotional currency and spend it on myself.”<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/28/magazine/confessions-of-a-seduction-addict.html?src=recg&_r=0 |title=Confessions of a Seduction Addict |author=Gilbert, Elizabeth |website=The New York Times |date=June 24, 2015 |accessdate=September 8, 2016}}</ref>

Gilbert was married to Michael Cooper, whom she met while working at the [[Coyote Ugly Saloon]], from 1994 to 2002.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/relationships/Eat-Pray-Love-Author-Elizabeth-Gilbert-On-Committed/5|title=What Comes After the Eating, the Praying and the Loving?|last=Kaylin|first=Lucy|date=January 2010|publisher=Oprah.com}}</ref>

In 2007 Gilbert married Jose Nuñes, whom she met in [[Bali]] while on her travels in ''Eat, Pray, Love''. Gilbert and Nuñes lived in [[Frenchtown, New Jersey|Frenchtown]], [[New Jersey]]; together they ran a large Asian import store called Two Buttons.

In 2015, Gilbert and several other authors (including [[Cheryl Strayed]]) participated in fundraising efforts for [[Syria]]n refugees. They raised over $1 million in 31 hours.<ref>Schaub, Michael [http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-compassion-collective-1-million-syrian-refugees-20151223-story.html Cheryl Strayed and Elizabeth Gilbert help raise $1 million for Syrian refugees] ''Los Angeles Times''.

On July 1, 2016 Gilbert announced on her Facebook page that she and her husband, Jose Nunes, were separating. She explained that the split was "very amicable" and that their reasons were "very personal".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/GilbertLiz/photos/a.356148997800555.79726.227291194019670/1054602967955151/?type=3&theater |title=Elizabeth Gilbert's verified Facebook page |author=Gilbert, Elizabeth |website=Facebook  |accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref> On September 7, 2016, Gilbert published a Facebook post saying that she was in a relationship with her best friend, writer [[Rayya Elias]], and that this relationship was related to the breakup of her marriage.
