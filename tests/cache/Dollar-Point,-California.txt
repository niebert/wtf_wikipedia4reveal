==History==
In 1884 the Glenbrook Mills logged 337 acres on a point on Lake Tahoe. In 1898 [[Lake Tahoe Railway and Transportation Company]] (D.L. Bliss) was formed and built {{Convert|16|miles|km}} of narrow gauge track into the area that became known as Dollar Point. [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific]] leased the track rights in 1925 and converted the tracks to [[Standard gauge]] in 1926, bought the property in 1933, and abandoned the tracks in 1943. In 1916 Lora Josephine Knight bought the point. The land was originally part of an area called Chinquapin by the [[Washoe people|Washoe Indians]]. [[Robert Dollar]] purchased many properties such as the 1,436 acres in [[Rossmoor, Walnut Creek, California|Rossmoor, California]] and in 1927 he purchased the area that had been called  "Old Lousy", "the lousy point", and Observatory Point, from Lora Knight. She became well known for building [[Vikingsholm]] Castle in 1929. She and her husband were also primary financial backers of [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s non-stop solo flight across the Atlantic.   

Dollar Point is located within the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada Mountain Range]] on the Northwest corner of Lake Tahoe.
