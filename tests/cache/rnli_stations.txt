'''Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) stations''' are the bases for the [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution|RNLI]]'s fleet of search and rescue [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboats]] that cover the coastal waters around the entire [[British Isles]], as well as major inland waterways.

The service was established in 1824 and is operated largely by volunteers. Its headquarters are at [[Poole]], [[Dorset]] and it is a registered charity in both the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland]].

== Key ==
=== Lifeboat types ===
{{Main|Royal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboats}}
The types of boats provided at each station and the launching methods vary depending on local needs. If more than one boat is provided they are sometimes stationed in separate buildings at different locations in the same town. RNLI boats fall into three broad groups:
* All weather lifeboats (ALBs): {{Lbb|Mersey}}, {{Lbb|Severn}}, {{Lbb|Shannon}}, {{Lbb|Tamar}}, {{Lbb|Trent}} and {{Lbb|Tyne}}
* Inshore lifeboats (ILBs): {{Lbc|D|IB1}}, {{Lbb|Atlantic 75}}, {{Lbb|Atlantic 85}} and {{Lbc|E}}
* Hovercraft: [[RNLI hovercraft lifeboat|''H''-class]]

=== Launch methods ===
[[File:Minehead - launching D-712 (2).jpg|thumb|'Tooltrack' tractor launching an inshore lifeboat at {{lbs|Minehead}}]]
The principal launching methods are:

* Carriage – an ALB or ILB is pushed into the water on a carriage by a tractor
* Davit – an ILB is lowered into the water by a crane
* Launchway – an ILB is pushed into the water on a carriage by hand
* Moored afloat – an ALB or ILB is kept in the water alongside the lifeboat station or nearby, in which case a small boarding boat is provided so that the crew can reach it.
* Slipway – an ALB slides down a slipway straight into the water.
* Transporter – hovercraft are kept on the rear of trucks that can transport and offload them anywhere

=== Divisions ===
The following lists do not include the lifeguard patrolled beaches which also have their own equipment including [[Arancia-class lifeboat|inflatable boats]] and [[jetski]]s. The information is correct to 2009 unless noted otherwise,<ref>{{cite book |last= Denton |first= Tony |title= Handbook 2009 |year= 2009 |publisher= Lifeboat Enthusiasts Society |location= Shrewsbury |pages= 66–71 }}</ref> and is set out like the RNLI's divisional model. As far as possible it follows a clockwise route around the coast.

* East Division – [[East Anglia]] and South East England
* South Division – South West England and the [[Channel Islands]]
* West Division – [[Wales]] and the [[Isle of Man]]
* North Division – East and west coasts of northern England
* Scotland Division – [[Scotland]]
* Ireland Division – [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]
