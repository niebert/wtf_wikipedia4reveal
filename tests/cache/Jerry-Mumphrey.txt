'''Jerry Wayne Mumphrey''' (born September 9, 1952) is a former [[Major League Baseball]] outfielder who played for the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] (1974–79), [[San Diego Padres]] (1980), [[New York Yankees]] (1981–83), [[Houston Astros]] (1983–85) and [[Chicago Cubs]] (1986–88). Mumphrey finished 20th in voting for the 1981 American League MVP and was the Astros All-Star Game representative in 1984.

Along with San Diego Padres' teammates [[Gene Richards (baseball)|Gene Richards]] and [[Ozzie Smith]], he was part of the first trio from the same team in MLB history to each steal 50 or more bases in a season (1980).

When Mumphrey was traded to the Cubs in December 1985, Cubs General Manager [[Dallas Green (baseball)|Dallas Green]] said: "By acquiring Jerry Mumphrey, we got someone who can play three outfield positions and play all three very well."<ref>{{cite web|last=Hannon |first=Tom |title=Jerry Mumphrey |url=http://www.thebaseballpage.com/players/mumphje01 |publisher=The Baseball Page |accessdate=2011-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718023438/http://www.thebaseballpage.com/players/mumphje01 |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }}</ref>
