'''Chemical biology''' is a scientific discipline spanning the fields of [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and [[physics]]. It involves the application of chemical techniques, tools, and analyses, and often compounds produced through [[chemical synthesis|synthetic chemistry]], to the study and manipulation of biological systems. Chemical biologists attempt to use chemical principles to modulate systems to either investigate the underlying biology or create new function. Research done by chemical biologists is often closer related to that of [[cell biology]] than [[biochemistry]]. Biochemists study the chemistry of biomolecules and regulation of biochemical pathways within cells and tissues, e.g. cAMP or cGMP, while chemical biologists deal with novel chemical compounds ''applied to'' biology.

==Introduction==
Some forms of chemical biology attempt to answer biological questions by directly probing living systems at the chemical level.  In contrast to research using [[biochemistry]], [[genetics]], or [[molecular biology]], where [[site-directed mutagenesis|mutagenesis]] can provide a new version of the organism or cell of interest, chemical biology studies probe systems ''[[in vitro]]'' and ''[[in vivo]]'' with [[small molecule]]s that have been designed for a specific purpose or identified on the basis of biochemical or cell-based screening.

Chemical biology is one of many [[interfacial sciences]] that are characteristic of a general trend away from older, [[reductionist]] fields toward those whose goals are to achieve a description of scientific [[holism]].  In this sense, it is related to other fields such as [[proteomics]]. Chemical biology has scientific, historical and philosophical roots in [[medicinal chemistry]], [[supramolecular chemistry]] (particularly [[host-guest chemistry]]), [[bioorganic chemistry]], [[pharmacology]], [[genetics]], [[biochemistry]], and [[metabolic engineering]].

==Systems of interest==

===Proteomics===
{{main article|Proteomics}}
[[Proteomics]] investigates the [[proteome]], the set of expressed proteins at a given time under defined conditions. As a discipline, proteomics has moved past rapid protein identification and has developed into a biological assay for quantitative analysis of complex protein samples by comparing protein changes in differently perturbed systems.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = ((Cox Jü)), Mann M | title = Is Proteomics the New Genomics? | journal = Cell | volume = 130 | issue = 3 | pages = 395–8 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17693247 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2007.07.032 }}</ref> Current goals in proteomics include determining [[protein sequences]], abundance and any [[post-translational modifications]]. Also of interest are [[protein–protein interactions]], cellular distribution of proteins and understanding protein activity. Another important aspect of proteomics is the advancement of technology to achieve these goals.

Protein levels, modifications, locations, and interactions are complex and dynamic properties. With this complexity in mind, experiments need to be carefully designed to answer specific questions especially in the face of the massive amounts of data that are generated by these analyses. The most valuable information comes from proteins that are expressed differently in a system being studied. These proteins can be compared relative to each other using [[quantitative proteomics]], which allows a protein to be labeled with a mass tag. Proteomic technologies must be sensitive and robust, it is for these reasons, the [[mass spectrometer]] has been the workhorse of protein analysis. The high precision of mass spectrometry can distinguish between closely related species and species of interest can be isolated and fragmented within the instrument. Its applications to protein analysis was only possible in the late 1980s with the development of protein and peptide ionization with minimal fragmentation. These breakthroughs were [[Electrospray ionization|ESI]] and [[MALDI]]. Mass spectrometry technologies are modular and can be chosen or optimized to the system of interest.

Chemical biologists are poised to impact proteomics through the development of techniques, probes and assays with [[synthetic chemistry]] for the characterization of protein samples of high complexity. These approaches include the development of enrichment strategies, chemical affinity tags and probes.

==== Enrichment techniques ====
Samples for Proteomics contain a myriad of peptide sequences, the sequence of interest may be highly represented or of low abundance. However, for successful MS analysis the peptide should be enriched within the sample. Reduction of sample complexity is achieved through selective enrichment using [[affinity chromatography]] techniques. This involves targeting a peptide with a distinguishing feature like a [[biotin label]] or a [[post translational modification]].<ref name="pmid19743430">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhao Y, Jensen ON | title = Modification-specific proteomics: strategies for characterization of post-translational modifications using enrichment techniques | journal = Proteomics | volume = 9 | issue = 20 | pages = 4632–41 |date=October 2009 | pmid = 19743430 | pmc = 2892724 | doi = 10.1002/pmic.200900398  }}</ref> Interesting methods have been developed that include the use of antibodies, lectins to capture glycoproteins, [[Immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography|immobilized metal ions]] to capture phosphorylated peptides and suicide enzyme substrates to capture specific enzymes. Here, chemical biologists can develop reagents to interact with substrates, specifically and tightly, to profile a targeted functional group on a proteome scale. Development of new enrichment strategies is needed in areas like non-ser/thr/tyr phosphorylation sites and other post translational modifications. Other methods of decomplexing samples relies on upstream [[chromatography|chromatographic separations]].

==== Affinity tags ====
Chemical synthesis of [[protein tag|affinity tags]] has been crucial to the maturation of quantitative proteomics. [[iTRAQ]], [[Tandem mass tags]] (TMT) and [[Isotope-coded affinity tag]] (ICAT) are protein mass-tags that consist of a covalently attaching group, a mass (isobaric or isotopic) encoded linker and a handle for isolation. Varying mass-tags bind to different proteins as a sort of footprint such that when analyzing cells of differing perturbations, the levels of each protein can be compared relatively after enrichment by the introduced handle. Other methods include [[SILAC]] and [[Isotopic labeling|heavy isotope labeling]]. These methods have been adapted to identify complexing proteins by labeling a bait protein, pulling it down and analyzing the proteins it has complexed.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = ((Gingras A-C)), Gstaiger M, Raught B, Aebersold R | title = Analysis of protein complexes using mass spectrometry | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = 645–54 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17593931 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2208 }}</ref> 
Another method creates an internal tag by introducing novel amino acids that are genetically encoded in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. These modifications create a new level of control and can facilitate photocrosslinking to probe protein–protein interactions.<ref name="pmid12404640">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chin JW, Schultz PG | title = In vivo photocrosslinking with unnatural amino Acid mutagenesis | journal = Chembiochem | volume = 3 | issue = 11 | pages = 1135–7 |date=November 2002 | pmid = 12404640 | doi = 10.1002/1439-7633(20021104)3:11<1135::AID-CBIC1135>3.0.CO;2-M }}</ref> In addition, keto, acetylene, azide, thioester, boronate, and dehydroalanine- containing amino acids can be used to selectively introduce tags, and novel chemical functional groups into proteins.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu W, Brock A, Chen S, Chen S, Schultz PG | title = Genetic incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins in mammalian cells | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 239–44 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17322890 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth1016 }}</ref>

==== Enzyme probes ====
To investigate enzymatic activity as opposed to total protein, activity-based reagents have been developed to label the enzymatically active form of proteins (see [[Activity-based proteomics]]). For example, serine hydrolase- and cysteine protease-inhibitors have been converted to [[suicide inhibitor]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = López-Otín C, Overall CM | title = Protease degradomics: A new challenge for proteomics | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 7 | pages = 509–19 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12094217 | doi = 10.1038/nrm858 }}</ref> This strategy enhances the ability to selectively analyze low abundance constituents through direct targeting. Structures that mimic these inhibitors could be introduced with modifications that will aid proteomic analysis- like an identification handle or mass tag.<ref name="pmid11182321">{{cite journal | vauthors = Adam GC, Cravatt BF, Sorensen EJ | title = Profiling the specific reactivity of the proteome with non-directed activity-based probes | journal = Chem. Biol. | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 81–95 |date=January 2001 | pmid = 11182321 | doi = 10.1016/S1074-5521(00)90060-7 }}</ref> Enzyme activity can also be monitored through converted substrate.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Tureček F | title = Mass spectrometry in coupling with affinity capture-release and isotope-coded affinity tags for quantitative protein analysis | journal = Journal of Mass Spectrometry | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–14 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11813306 | doi = 10.1002/jms.275 }}</ref> This strategy relies on using synthetic substrate conjugates that contain moieties that are acted upon by specific enzymes. The product conjugates are then captured by an affinity reagent and analyzed. The measured concentration of product conjugate allow the determination of the enzyme velocity. Identification of enzyme substrates (of which there may be hundreds or thousands, many of which unknown) is a problem of significant difficulty in proteomics and is vital to the understanding of signal transduction pathways in cells; techniques for labelling cellular substrates of enzymes is an area chemical biologists can address. A method that has been developed uses "analog-sensitive" kinases to label substrates using an unnatural ATP analog, facilitating visualization and identification through a unique handle.<ref name="pmid18265343">{{cite journal | vauthors = Blethrow J, Zhang C, Shokat KM, Weiss EL | title = Design and use of analog-sensitive protein kinases | journal = Curr Protoc Mol Biol | volume = Chapter 18 | issue = | pages = Unit 18.11 |date=May 2004 | pmid = 18265343 | doi = 10.1002/0471142727.mb1811s66 }}</ref>

===Glycobiology===
While [[DNA]], [[RNA]] and proteins are all encoded at the genetic level, there exists a separate system of trafficked molecules in the cell that are not encoded directly at any direct level: sugars. Thus, [[glycomics|glycobiology]] is an area of dense research for chemical biologists. For instance, live cells can be supplied with synthetic variants of natural sugars in order to probe the function of the sugars in vivo. [[Carolyn R. Bertozzi|Carolyn Bertozzi]], previously at [[University of California, Berkeley]], has developed a method for site-specifically reacting molecules the surface of cells that have been labeled with synthetic sugars.

===Combinatorial chemistry===
Chemical biologists used automated synthesis of many diverse compounds in order to experiment with effects of small molecules on biological processes. More specifically, they observe changes in the behaviors of [[protein]]s when small molecules bind to them. Such experiments may supposedly lead to discovery of small molecules with [[antibiotic]] or chemotherapeutic properties.  These approaches are identical to those employed in the discipline of pharmacology.

===Molecular sensing===
Chemical biologists are also interested in developing new small-molecule and biomolecule-based tools to study biological processes, often by molecular imaging techniques.<ref>[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cb700248m Bright Ideas for Chemical Biology – ACS Chemical Biology (ACS Publications)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The field of molecular sensing was popularized by [[Roger Tsien]]'s work developing calcium-sensing fluorescent compounds as well as pioneering the use of [[Green fluorescent protein|GFP]], for which he was awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2008/index.html The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Today, researchers continue to utilize basic chemical principles to develop new compounds for the study of biological metabolites and processes.

===siRNA-A tool in chemical biology===
[[siRNA]] or small interfering RNAs owe their origins to the difficulties the scientific community faced utilizing classical and reverse [[genetics]] methods in studying gene expression. Disrupting genes to study their functions is not always optimal; neither is mapping mutations back to their genes easy. The whole process is expensive as well as time-consuming, which is why a lot of effort has been devoted to develop methods to silence gene expression in sequence specific manner using nucleic acids. They have the potential to be powerful tools in the field of chemical biology to study the chemistry of gene expression in therapeutic targets of bacteria and viruses.

A number of different types of nucleic acid molecules have already gained prominence because of their potential as therapeutics. They target mRNAs to silence the genes in a sequence specific manner. Oligodeoxyribonucleic acids, ODNs<ref name="pmid14576293">{{cite journal | vauthors = Uil TG, Haisma HJ, Rots MG | title = Therapeutic modulation of endogenous gene function by agents with designed DNA-sequence specificities | journal = Nucleic Acids Res. | volume = 31 | issue = 21 | pages = 6064–78 |date=November 2003 | pmid = 14576293 | pmc = 275457 | doi =  10.1093/nar/gkg815 }}</ref> utilize steric interaction to silence gene expression. They can also form triple helices in conjunction with the [[DNA]] duplex. Whereas ribozymes<ref name="pmid12097172">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuwabara T, Warashina M, Taira K | title = Cleavage of an inaccessible site by the maxizyme with two independent binding arms: an alternative approach to the recruitment of RNA helicases | journal = J. Biochem. | volume = 132 | issue = 1 | pages = 149–55 |date=July 2002 | pmid = 12097172 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a003193}}</ref><ref name="pmid12110898">{{cite journal | vauthors = Doudna JA, Cech TR | title = The chemical repertoire of natural ribozymes | journal = Nature | volume = 418 | issue = 6894 | pages = 222–8 |date=July 2002 | pmid = 12110898 | doi = 10.1038/418222a |bibcode = 2002Natur.418..222D }}</ref> can be chemically designed to target specific genes and cleave them in a sequence specific manner. The most promising of these methods however is utilization of short interfering RNA or siRNA to silence gene expression.

====siRNA====
[[siRNA]] or short interfering [[RNA]]s exist in nature as a means for the express purpose of controlling gene expression. It was discovered in petunia as a post-transcriptional gene silencing measure.<ref name="pmid10542148">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hamilton AJ, Baulcombe DC | title = A species of small antisense RNA in posttranscriptional gene silencing in plants | journal = Science | volume = 286 | issue = 5441 | pages = 950–2 |date=October 1999 | pmid = 10542148 | doi = 10.1126/science.286.5441.950 }}</ref> It is the resultant product when a long double-strand RNA of 20 -25 [[nucleotides]] length was processed in the cells by the enzyme DICER. The newly synthesized siRNA assemble into endoribonuclease-containing complexes known as RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs), unwinding in the process. The activated RISC then binds to the complementary RNA molecules by base pairing interactions between the siRNA strand and the mRNA, which is then cleaved. This mechanism is known as RNA interference or [[RNAi]].<ref name="pmid9486653">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fire A, Xu S, Montgomery MK, Kostas SA, Driver SE, Mello CC | title = Potent and specific genetic interference by double-strand RNA in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Nature | volume = 391 | issue = 6669 | pages = 806–11 |date=February 1998 | pmid = 9486653 | doi = 10.1038/35888 |bibcode = 1998Natur.391..806F }}</ref><ref name="pmid15950871">{{cite journal | author = Baulcombe D | title = RNA silencing | journal = Trends Biochem.

=====Designing and synthesizing siRNAs=====
It is now possible to order siRNAs designed and synthesized with the express purpose of targeting a particular sequence. 
The ambion website has a lot of information on the optimal design of siRNAs.

siRNAs can be synthesized chemically, or enzymatically. RNase III or DICER can be used to cleave the long dsRNAs to produce siRNAs. However the most expedient method is the use of plasmids to express them in vivo by delivering them into the target cell using vectors. This method allows the siRNAs to be expressed in the target cell stably, over a period of time and overcomes the drawbacks of the transience of their effect. Numerous strategies have been developed in order to deliver the siRNA into the cell efficiently:<ref name="pmid21078116">{{cite journal | vauthors = Shim MS, Kwon YJ | title = Efficient and targeted delivery of siRNA in vivo | journal = FEBS J. | volume = 277 | issue = 23 | pages = 4814–27 |date=December 2010 | pmid = 21078116 | doi = 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07904.x }}</ref>
#Electroporation
#Local and systemic injection: This method was the first success scientists had in silencing genes using siRNAs. They were successfully delivered into highly vascularized tissue in mice through using high-pressure tail vein injection. Greater than 90% loss in gene expression was observed in the targets.
#siRNA producing viruses: This method shows great promise in gene therapy, and research is progressing in order to generate recombinant viruses that can produce siRNA in target cells.
#Small molecules that enhance transdermal penetration: Research in this field is moving at a fast pace in order to synthesize small organic molecules that, if injected in conjunction with siRNAs, can help them penetrate into the target cells.

=====Biological uses of the RNAi approach=====
The principal purpose of studying siRNA mediated RNA interference is probably to investigate gene function.<ref name="pmid15060527">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dorsett Y, Tuschl T | title = siRNAs: applications in functional genomics and potential as therapeutics | journal = Nature Reviews Drug Discovery  | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 318–29 |date=April 2004 | pmid = 15060527 | doi = 10.1038/nrd1345 }}</ref>
 
It is so much easier to make genetic knock-outs by simply introducing sequence-specific siRNAs into cells; multi-copy genes can be silenced in one fell swoop by this method. Creation of double-knockout mutants is also easier and consumes much less time. Using local injections in specific regions of the model organisms also help in creating spatially separated and restricted knockout.
siRNAs are also being successfully used to screen whole genomes in organisms such as ''C. elegans'' and ''Drosophilla melanogaster''. Even in mammalian systems such as ''Danio rerio'' (zebrafish) that usually prove intractable to all gene silencing methods, even dsRNA injection, siRNA can do the job. It is paving a new way in development of therapeutics by identifying human gene orthologs in other species in a remarkably short{{Clarify|date=November 2011}} period of time.

Numerous high-throughput screening approaches are being developed to screen large libraries of cells rapidly in order to identify drug targets.<ref name="pmid20367032">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mohr S, Bakal C, Perrimon N | author3-link = Perrimon N | title = Genomic screening with RNAi: results and challenges | journal = Annu. Rev. Biochem. | volume = 79 | issue = | pages = 37–64 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20367032 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060408-092949 | pmc=3564595}}</ref>
A brief description of few of the screening techniques:
#Pooled Format Screening: A reagent library of RNAi has to be introduced to the cells so that a particular cell is in one particular reagent. The primary hits are then identified and their identity elucidated by sequencing techniques.
#Arrayed Format Screening:  Each RNAi reagent is placed in separate wells in a plate and multiple manipulations can be done to identify their targets, which are then detected by fluorescence readouts, imaging techniques and other methods as well. Thus the identity of the target cell can be determined through the identity of the reagent in the database.
#Multiplexed methods: A combination of various assays can be used for high-throughput screening of candidate drug targets. For example, candidate genes can be identified through informatics based methods and then screened against a library of reagents. Many other such methods are being developed in order to make the job of screening therapeutic targets easier.

=====siRNA based therapeutics=====
The future in this field rests in the development of [[siRNA]]-based drugs.<ref name="pmid15496962">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ryther RC, Flynt AS, Phillips JA, Patton JG | title = siRNA therapeutics: big potential from small RNAs | journal = Gene Ther. | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–11 |date=January 2005 | pmid = 15496962 | doi = 10.1038/sj.gt.3302356 }}</ref>
 
This could prove to be a powerful tool in gene based therapy.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Research is now concentrated on developing strategies to design siRNA therapeutics for clinical use.  A brief description of some novel strategies for siRNA drug development is provided here:
#Direct [[Mutation]] Targeting: The siRNAs are designed to perfectly match mutant alleles but contain one or more mismatches with wild-type alleles, leading to specific degradation of the matching, mutant transcripts.
#Indirect Mutation Targeting: The siRNA approach will not work if the mutant alleles are too similar to wild type.  So an indirect approach is taken in which siRNAs are designed against disease linked markers such as SNP variations. The ones that are screened  as positive are targeted for degradation.
#[[Exon]]-specific targeting: siRNAs are designed to target expressed regions (exons) of the gene.
#Targeting exon skipped transcripts: If the problem in the gene lies in aberrant splicing post-transcription, siRNA can be designed to target the unnatural exon-exon interface arising as a result of such alternative splicing.

===Employing biology===
Many research programs are also focused on employing natural biomolecules to perform a task or act as support for a new chemical method or material. In this regard, researchers have shown that DNA can serve as a template for synthetic chemistry, self-assembling proteins can serve as a structural scaffold for new materials, and RNA can be evolved ''in vitro'' to produce new catalytic function.

===Protein misfolding and aggregation as a cause of disease===
A common form of aggregation is long, ordered spindles called amyloid fibrils that are implicated in Alzheimer’s disease and that have been shown to consist of cross-linked [[beta sheet]] regions perpendicular to the backbone of the polypeptide.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jordens S, Adamcik J, Amar-Yuli I, Mezzenga R | title = Disassembly and Reassembly of Amyloid Fibrils in Water−Ethanol Mixtures | journal = Biomacromolecules | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 187–93 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21142059 | doi = 10.1021/bm101119t }}</ref> Another form of aggregation occurs with [[prion| prion proteins]], the glycoproteins found with [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]] and [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]]. In both structures, aggregation occurs through [[hydrophobic effect|hydrophobic interactions]] and water must be excluded from the binding surface before aggregation can occur.<ref name="pmid21098298">{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy G, Straub JE, Thirumalai D | title = Dry amyloid fibril assembly in a yeast prion peptide is mediated by long-lived structures containing water wires | journal = Proc.

Through the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] process, [[DNA]] encodes for specific sequences of [[amino acids]]. The resulting polypeptides [[Protein folding|fold]] into more complex secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures to form proteins. Based on both the sequence and the structure, a particular protein is conferred its cellular function. However, sometimes the folding process fails due to mutations in the genetic code and thus the amino acid sequence or due to changes in the cell environment (e.g. pH, temperature, reduction potential, etc.). Misfolding occurs more often in aged individuals or in cells exposed to a high degree of [[oxidative stress]], but a fraction of all proteins misfold at some point even in the healthiest of cells.

Normally when a protein does not fold correctly, [[molecular chaperones]] in the cell can encourage refolding back into its active form.   When refolding is not an option, the cell can also target the protein for degradation back into its component amino acids via [[Proteasome|proteolytic]], [[Lysosome|lysosomal]], or [[Autophagy (cellular)|autophagic]] mechanisms. However, under certain conditions or with certain mutations, the cells can no longer cope with the misfolded protein(s) and a disease state results. Either the protein has a loss-of-function, such as in [[cystic fibrosis]], in which it loses activity or cannot reach its target, or the protein has a gain-of-function, such as with [[Alzheimer's disease]], in which the protein begins to aggregate causing it to become insoluble and non-functional.

Protein misfolding has previously been studied using both computational approaches as well as ''in vivo'' biological assays in [[model organisms]] such as ''Drosophila melanogaster'' and ''C. elegans''. Computational models use a ''de novo'' process to calculate possible protein structures based on input parameters such as amino acid sequence, solvent effects, and mutations. This method has the shortcoming that the cell environment has been drastically simplified, which limits the factors that influence folding and stability. On the other hand, biological assays can be quite complicated to perform ''in vivo'' with [[high-throughput screening|high-throughput]] like efficiency and there always remains the question of how well lower organism systems approximate human systems.

=== Chemical synthesis of peptides ===
{{main article|Peptide synthesis}}
In contrast to the traditional biotechnological practice of obtaining [[peptides]] or [[proteins]] by isolation from cellular hosts through cellular [[protein production]], advances in chemical techniques for the synthesis and ligation of peptides has allowed for the total synthesis of some peptides and proteins. Chemical synthesis of proteins is a valuable tool in chemical biology as it allows for the introduction of non-natural amino acids as well as residue specific incorporation of "[[posttranslational modification]]s" such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, acetylation, and even [[ubiquitin]]ation. These capabilities are valuable for chemical biologists as non-natural amino acids can be used to probe and alter the functionality of proteins, while post translational modifications are widely known to regulate the structure and activity of proteins. Although strictly biological techniques have been developed to achieve these ends, the chemical synthesis of peptides often has a lower technical and practical barrier to obtaining small amounts of the desired protein. Given the widely recognized importance of proteins as cellular catalysts and recognition elements, the ability to precisely control the composition and connectivity of polypeptides is a valued tool in the chemical biology community and is an area of active research.
 
While chemists have been making peptides for over 100 years,<ref name=reference2>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kimmerlin T, Seebach D | title = '100 years of peptide synthesis': ligation methods for peptide and protein synthesis with applications to beta-peptide assemblies | journal = J Pept Res | volume = 65 | issue = 2 | pages = 229–260 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15705167 | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-3011.2005.00214.x }}</ref> the ability to efficiently and quickly synthesize short peptides came of age with the development of [[Bruce Merrifield]]'s [[peptide synthesis|solid phase peptide synthesis]] (SPPS). Prior to the development of SPPS, the concept of step-by-step polymer synthesis on an insoluble support was without chemical precedent.<ref name="pmid16778881">{{cite journal | author = Kent S | title = Obituary: Bruce Merrifield (1921–2006) | journal = Nature | volume = 441 | issue = 7095 | pages = 824 |date=June 2006 | pmid = 16778881 | doi = 10.1038/441824a |bibcode = 2006Natur.441..824K }}</ref> The use of a covalently bound insoluble polymeric support greatly simplified the process of peptide synthesis by reducing purification to a simple "filtration and wash" procedure and facilitated a boom in the field of peptide chemistry. The development and "optimization" of SPPS took peptide synthesis from the hands of the specialized peptide synthesis community and put it into the hands of the broader chemistry, biochemistry, and now chemical biology community. SPPS is still the method of choice for linear synthesis of polypeptides up to 50 residues in length<ref name="pmid16778881"/> and has been implemented in commercially available automated peptide synthesizers. One inherent shortcoming in any procedure that calls for repeated coupling reactions is the buildup of side products resulting from incomplete couplings and side reactions. This places the upper bound for the synthesis of linear polypeptide lengths at around 50 amino acids, while the "average" protein consists of 250 amino acids.<ref name=reference2/> Clearly, there was a need for development of "non-linear" methods to allow synthetic access to the average protein.

Although the shortcomings of linear SPPS were recognized not long after its inception, it took until the early 1990s for effective methodology to be developed to ligate small peptide fragments made by SPPS, into protein sized polypeptide chains (for recent review of peptide ligation strategies, see review by Dawson ''et al.''<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dirksen A, Dawson PE | title = Expanding the scope of chemoselective peptide ligations in chemical biology | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 760–6 | year = 2008 | pmid = 19058994 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.10.009 }}</ref>). The oldest and best developed of these methods is termed [[native chemical ligation]]. Native chemical ligation was unveiled in a 1994 paper from the laboratory of [[Stephen Kent (chemist)|Stephen B.

Expressed protein ligation allows for the biotechnological installation of a C-terminal thioester using [[intein]] biochemistry, thereby allowing the appendage of a synthetic N-terminal peptide to the recombinantly produced C-terminal portion. This technique allows for access to much larger proteins, as only the N-terminal portion of the resulting protein has to be chemically synthesized. Both sulfurization/desulfurization techniques and the use of removable thiol auxiliaries involve the installation of a synthetic thiol moiety to carry out the standard native chemical ligation chemistry, followed by removal of the auxiliary/thiol. These techniques help to overcome the requirement of an N-terminal cysteine needed for standard native chemical ligation, although the steric requirements for the C-terminal residue are still limiting.

===Protein design by directed evolution===
{{main article|Directed evolution}}
One of the primary goals of [[protein engineering]] is the design of novel [[peptides]] or [[proteins]] with a desired structure and chemical activity. Because our knowledge of the relationship between primary sequence, structure, and function of proteins is limited, [[protein design|rational design]] of new proteins with [[enzyme|enzymatic activity]] is extremely challenging. Directed evolution, repeated cycles of genetic diversification followed by a screening or selection process, can be used to mimic [[natural selection|Darwinian evolution]] in the laboratory to design new proteins with a desired activity.<ref name="pmid18573077">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jäckel C, Kast P, Hilvert D | title = Protein design by directed evolution | journal = Annu Rev Biophys | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 153–73 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18573077 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biophys.37.032807.125832 }}</ref>

Several methods exist for creating large libraries of sequence variants. Among the most widely used are subjecting [[DNA]] to [[UV radiation]] or [[mutagen|chemical mutagens]], [[PCR|error-prone PCR]], [[genetic code|degenerate codons]], or [[genetic recombination|recombination]].<ref name="Bittker_2004"/><ref name="pmid15118093">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bittker JA, Le BV, Liu JM, Liu DR | title = Directed evolution of protein enzymes using nonhomologous random recombination | journal = Proc.

Since only proteins with the desired activity are selected, multiple rounds of directed evolution lead to proteins with an accumulation beneficial traits.

There are two general strategies for choosing the starting sequence for a directed evolution experiment: ''de novo'' design and redesign. In a protein design experiment, an initial sequence is chosen at random and subjected to multiple rounds of directed evolution. For example, this has been employed successfully to create a family of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]-binding proteins with a new folding pattern not found in nature.<ref name="pmid15024384">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lo Surdo P, Walsh MA, Sollazzo M | title = A novel ADP- and zinc-binding fold from function-directed in vitro evolution | journal = Nature Structural & Molecular Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 382–3 |date=April 2004 | pmid = 15024384 | doi = 10.1038/nsmb745 }}</ref> Random sequences can also be biased towards specific folds by specifying the characteristics (such as polar vs. nonpolar) but not the specific identity of each amino acid in a sequence.

[[computational chemistry|Computational methods]], when combined with experimental approaches, can significantly assist both the design and redesign of new proteins through directed evolution.

By identifying lead sequences using computational methods, the occurrence of functional proteins in libraries can be dramatically increased before any directed evolution experiments in the laboratory.

===Biocompatible click cycloaddition reactions in chemical biology===
Recent advances in technology have allowed scientists to view substructures of cells at levels of unprecedented detail.  Unfortunately these "aerial" pictures offer little information about the mechanics of the biological system in question.  To be fully effective, precise imaging systems require a complementary technique that better elucidates the machinery of a cell.  By attaching tracking devices (optical probes) to [[biomolecules]] ''in vivo'', one can learn far more about [[cell metabolism]], [[molecular transport]], [[cell-cell interaction]]s and many other processes<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jewett JC, Bertozzi CR | title = Cu-free click cycloaddition reactions in chemical biology | journal = Chemical Society Reviews | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 1272–9 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20349533 | pmc = 2865253 | doi = 10.1039/b901970g }}.</ref>

====Bioorthogonal reactions====
Successful labeling of a molecule of interest requires specific functionalization of that molecule to react chemospecifically with an optical probe.

Many of the reactions normally available to organic chemists in the laboratory are unavailable in living systems.  Water- and redox- sensitive reactions would not proceed, reagents prone to nucleophilic attack would offer no chemospecificity, and any reactions with large kinetic barriers would not find enough energy in the relatively low-heat environment of a living cell.
Thus, chemists have recently developed a panel of [[bioorthogonal chemistry]] that proceed chemospecifically, despite the milieu of distracting reactive materials ''in vivo''.

====Design of bioorthogonal reagents and bioorthogonal chemical reporters====
The coupling of an optical probe to a molecule of interest must occur within a reasonably short time frame; therefore, the kinetics of the coupling reaction should be highly favorable.

====Use in biological systems====
As mentioned above, the use of bioorthogonal reactions to tag biomolecules requires that one half of the reactive "click" pair is installed in the target molecule, while the other is attached to an optical probe.  When the probe is added to a biological system, it will selectively conjugate with the target molecule.

The most common method of installing bioorthogonal reactivity into a target biomolecule is through metabolic labeling.  Cells are immersed in a medium where access to nutrients is limited to synthetically modified analogues of standard fuels such as sugars.  As a consequence, these altered biomolecules are incorporated into the cells in the same manner as their wild-type brethren.  The optical probe is then incorporated into the system to image the fate of the altered biomolecules.  Other methods of functionalization include enzymatically inserting [[azides]] into [[proteins]],<ref name="pmid19345117">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hur GH, Meier JL, Baskin J, Codelli JA, Bertozzi CR, Marahiel MA, Burkart MD | title = Crosslinking studies of protein–protein interactions in nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis | journal = Chem.

====Future directions====
As these bioorthogonal reactions are further optimized, they will likely be used for increasingly complex interactions involving multiple different classes of biomolecules.  More complex interactions have a smaller margin for error, so increased reaction efficiency is paramount to continued success in optically probing cellular machinery.  Also, by minimizing side reactions, the experimental design of a minimally perturbed living system is closer to being realized.

===Discovery of biomolecules through metagenomics===
{{main article|Metagenomics}}
The advances in modern sequencing technologies in the late 1990s allowed scientists to investigate DNA of communities of organisms in their natural environments, so-called "eDNA", without culturing individual species in the lab. This metagenomic approach enabled scientists to study a wide selection of organisms that were previously not characterized due in part to an incompetent growth condition. These sources of eDNA include, but are not limited to, [[soils]], ocean, [[Subsurface (geology)|subsurface]], [[hot springs]], [[hydrothermal vents]], [[polar ice caps]], hypersaline habitats, and extreme pH environments.<ref name="pmid15040261">{{cite journal | vauthors = Keller M, Zengler K | title = Tapping into microbial diversity | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology  | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 141–50 |date=February 2004 | pmid = 15040261 | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro819 }}</ref> Of the many applications of metagenomics, chemical biologists and microbiologists such as [[Jo Handelsman]], [[Jon Clardy]], and [[Robert M.

[[Functional symptom|Functional]] or [[homology (biology)|homology]] screening strategies have been used to identify genes that produce small bioactive molecules. Functional metagenomic studies are designed to search for specific [[phenotypes]] that are associated with molecules with specific characteristics. Homology metagenomic studies, on the other hand, are designed to examine genes to identify [[conserved sequences]] that are previously associated with the expression of biologically active molecules.<ref name="Banik_2010">{{cite journal | vauthors = Banik JJ, Brady SF | title = Recent application of metagenomic approaches toward the discovery of antimicrobials and other bioactive small molecules | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 603–609 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20884282 | pmc = 3111150 | doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2010.08.012 }}</ref>
	
Functional metagenomic studies enable scientists to discover novel genes that encode biologically active molecules. These assays include top agar overlay assays where antibiotics generate zones of growth inhibition against test microbes, and pH assays that can screen for pH change due to newly synthesized molecules using pH indicator on an [[agar]] plate.<ref name="Daniel_2005">{{cite journal | author = Daniel R | title = The metagenomics of soil | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | pages = 470–478 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15931165 | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro1160 }}</ref> Substrate-induced gene expression screening (SIGEX), a method to screen for the expression of genes that are induced by chemical compounds, has also been used to search genes with specific functions.<ref name = "Daniel_2005"/> These led to the discovery and isolation of several novel proteins and small molecules. For example, the Schipper group identified three eDNA derived AHL [[lactonase]]s that inhibit [[biofilm]] formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa via functional metagenomic assays.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schipper C, Hornung C, Bijtenhoorn P, Quitschau M, Grond S, Streit WR | title = Metagenome-Derived Clones Encoding Two Novel Lactonase Family Proteins Involved in Biofilm Inhibition in Pseudomonas aeruginosa | journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology | volume = 75 | issue = 1 | pages = 224–233 | year = 2009 | pmid = 18997026 | pmc = 2612230 | doi = 10.1128/AEM.01389-08 }}</ref> However, these functional screening methods require a good design of probes that detect molecules being synthesized and depend on the ability to express metagenomes in a host organism system.<ref name="Daniel_2005"/>
	
In contrast, homology metagenomic studies led to a faster discovery of genes that have homologous sequences as the previously known genes that are responsible for the [[biosynthesis]] of biologically active molecules. As soon as the genes are sequenced, scientists can compare thousands of bacterial genomes simultaneously.<ref name="Banik_2010"/> The advantage over functional metagenomic assays is that homology metagenomic studies do not require a host organism system to express the metagenomes, thus this method can potentially save the time spent on analyzing nonfunctional genomes. These also led to the discovery of several novel proteins and small molecules. For example, Banik et al. screened for clones containing genes associated with the synthesis of teicoplanin and vancomycin-like [[glycopeptide]] [[antibiotics]] and found two new biosynthetic gene clusters.<ref name="pmid20834152">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bunterngsook B, Kanokratana P, Thongaram T, Tanapongpipat S, Uengwetwanit T, Rachdawong S, Vichitsoonthonkul T, Eurwilaichitr L | title = Identification and characterization of lipolytic enzymes from a peat-swamp forest soil metagenome | journal = Biosci.

However, collaborative efforts from individuals from diverse fields including [[Microbial genetics|bacterial genetics]], [[molecular biology]], [[genomics]], [[bioinformatics]], [[robots]], [[synthetic biology]], and [[chemistry]] can solve this problem together and potentially lead to the discovery of many important biologically active molecules.<ref name="Banik_2010"/>

===Protein phosphorylation===
[[Posttranslational modification]] of proteins with [[phosphate]] groups has proven to be a key regulatory step throughout all biological systems.  Phosphorylation events, either phosphorylation by protein [[kinase]]s or dephosphorylation by [[phosphatases]], result in protein activation or deactivation.  These events have an immense impact on the regulation of physiological pathways, which makes the ability to dissect and study these pathways integral to understanding the details of cellular processes.   There exist a number of challenges—namely the sheer size of the phosphoproteome, the fleeting nature of phosphorylation events and related physical limitations of classical biological and biochemical techniques—that have limited the advancement of knowledge in this area.  A recent review<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tarrant MK, Cole PA | title = The Chemical Biology of Protein Phosphorylation | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 78 | issue =  | pages = 797–825 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19489734 | pmc = 3074175 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.78.070907.103047 }}</ref> provides a detailed examination of the impact of newly developed chemical approaches to dissecting and studying biological systems both in vitro and in vivo.

Through the use of a number of classes of small molecule modulators of protein kinases, chemical biologists have been able to gain a better understanding of the effects of protein phosphorylation.  For example, nonselective and selective kinase inhibitors, such as a class of pyridinylimidazole compounds described by Wilson, et al.,<ref name="pmid9224565">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilson KP, McCaffrey PG, Hsiao K, Pazhanisamy S, Galullo V, Bemis GW, Fitzgibbon MJ, Caron PR, Murcko MA, Su MS | title = The structural basis for the specificity of pyridinylimidazole inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase | journal = Chem.

These pyridinylimidazole compounds function by targeting the [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] binding pocket.  Although this approach, as well as related approaches,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pargellis C, Ton L, Churchill L, CIrillo PF, Gilmore T, Graham AG, Grob PM, Hickey ER, Moss N | title =Inhibition of [[p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases|p38 MAP kinase]] by utilizing a novel allosteric binding site | journal = Nature Structural & Molecular Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 268–272 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11896401 | doi = 10.1038/nsb770 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schindler T, Bornmann W, Pellicena P, Miller WT, Clarckson B, Kuriyan J | title = Structural mechanism for STI-571 inhibition of Abelson tyrosine kinase | journal = Science | volume = 289 | issue = 5486 | pages = 1938–1942 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10988075 | doi = 10.1126/science.289.5486.1938 |bibcode = 2000Sci...289.1938S }}</ref> with slight modifications, has proven effective in a number of cases, these compounds lack adequate specificity for more general applications.  Another class of compounds, mechanism-based inhibitors, combines detailed knowledge of the chemical mechanism of kinase action with previously utilized inhibition motifs.  For example, Parang, et al. describe the development of a "bisubstrate analog" that inhibits kinase action by binding both the conserved ATP binding pocket and a protein/peptide recognition site on the specific kinase.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Parang K, Till JH, Ablooglu AJ, Kohanski RA, Hubbard SR, Cole PA | title = Mechanism-based design of a protein kinase inhibitor | journal = Nature Structural & Molecular Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–41 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11135668 | doi = 10.1038/83028 }}</ref> While there is no published in vivo data on compounds of this type, the structural data acquired from in vitro studies have expanded the current understanding of how a number of important kinases recognize target substrates.

The development of novel chemical means of incorporating [[phosphomimetics]] into proteins has provided important insight into the effects of phosphorylation events.  Historically, phosphorylation events have been studied by mutating an identified phosphorylation site ([[serine]], [[threonine]] or [[tyrosine]]) to an amino acid, such as [[alanine]], that cannot be phosphorylated.   While this approach has been successful in some cases, mutations are permanent in vivo and can have potentially detrimental effects on protein folding and stability. Thus, chemical biologists have developed new ways of investigating protein phosphorylation.  By installing phospho-serine, phospho-threonine or analogous [[phosphonate]] mimics into native proteins, researchers are able to perform in vivo studies to investigate the effects of phosphorylation by extending the amount of time a phosphorylation event occurs while minimizing the often-unfavorable effects of mutations.  Protein semisynthesis, or more specifically [[expressed protein ligation]] (EPL), has proven to be successful techniques for synthetically producing proteins that contain phosphomimetic molecules at either the C- or the N-terminus.<ref name="pmid9618476"/> In addition, researchers have built upon an established technique in which one can insert an unnatural amino acid into a peptide sequence by charging synthetic tRNA that recognizes a nonsense codon with an unnatural amino acid.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Noren CJ, Anthony-Cahill SJ, Griffith MC, Schultz PG | title = A general method for site-specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins | journal = Science | volume = 244 | issue = 4901 | pages = 182–188 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2649980 | doi = 10.1126/science.2649980 |bibcode = 1989Sci...244..182N }}</ref> Recent developments indicate that this technique can also be employed in vivo, although, due to permeability issues, these in vivo experiments using phosphomimetic molecules have not yet been possible.<ref name="pmid16689635">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang L, Xie J, Schultz PG | title = Expanding the genetic code | journal = Annu Rev Biophys Biomol Struct | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 225–49 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16689635 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biophys.35.101105.121507 }}</ref>

Advances in chemical biology have also improved upon classical techniques of imaging kinase action.  For example, the development of [[peptide biosensors]]—peptides containing incorporated [[fluorophore]] molecules—allowed for improved temporal resolution in in vitro binding assays.<ref name="pmid17881302">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharma V, Wang Q, Lawrence DS | title = Peptide-based fluorescent sensors of protein kinase activity: design and applications | journal = Biochim.

One of the most useful techniques to study kinase action is [[Förster resonance energy transfer|Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer]] (FRET).  To utilize FRET for phosphorylation studies, fluorescent proteins are coupled to both a phosphoamino acid binding domain and a peptide that can by phosphorylated.  Upon phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of a substrate peptide, a conformational change occurs that results in a change in fluorescence.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Violin JD, Zhang J, Tsein RY, Newton AC | title = A genetically encoded fluorescent reporter reveals oscillatory phosphorylation by protein kinase C | journal = J.

Through the augmentation of classical biochemical methods as well as the development of new tools and techniques, chemical biologists have improved accuracy and precision in the study of protein phosphorylation.

===Metal complexes in medicine===
Metal complexes have many characteristics that can be advantageous in drug design. In comparison to organic-based medicines, metal complexes have many more [[Coordination Number]]s, geometries, and [[Oxidation state|oxidation/reduction]] states that can be used to make structures that interact with targets in unique ways unavailable to most organic molecules. In addition, the cationic metal is advantageous in complexing with charged targets within biological systems like the phosphate backbone of [[DNA]]. Targets of metal-based medicines include [[DNA]], [[protein]]s, and [[enzyme]]s. Each target tupe is described in turn below.

====Metal complexes targeting DNA====
DNA has been the primary target of metal complexes due to the ability of cationic metal interacting with the anionic backbone of DNA. The anticancer chemotherapy drug [[cisplatin]] covalently binds to DNA, which disrupts [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and leads to [[apoptosis|programmed cell death]].<ref name="Che, C. M. 2010">{{cite journal | vauthors = Che CM, Siu FM | title = Metal complexes in medicine with a focus on enzyme inhibition | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 255–261 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20018553 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2009.11.015 }}</ref> Assuming early detection, cisplatin cures almost all cases of [[testicular cancer]].

Another major effort for anticancer metal-based drugs centers around stabilization of the [[G-quadruplex]] of DNA. In general, these drugs have a non-covalent interaction with the [[G-quadruplex]] as well as a planar positively charged structure.<ref name="Che, C. M. 2010"/>

====Metal complexes targeting enzymes and proteins====
Though DNA has been a primary target for inorganic medicines, enzymes, and proteins also can be modulated through interactions with these compounds. Metal complexes can interact with the [[amino acid]]s with the highest [[reduction potential]] ([[histidine]], [[cysteine]], and [[selenocysteine]]).<ref name="Che, C. M. 2010"/> Metals used in such complexes include gold, platinum, ruthenium, vanadium, [[cobalt]] and others. Several new potential therapeutic complexes are currently in the process of discovery and investigation.

=====Gold=====
Some gold complexes are showing potential as medicines.  A rheumatoid arthritis drug ([[auranofin]], a gold(I) phosphine complex) has shown value in treating parasitic disease through inhibiting [[glutathione reductase|thioredoxin glutathione reductase]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Angelucci F, Sayed AA, Williams DL, Boumis G, Brunori M, Dimastrogiovanni D, Miele AE, Pauly F, Bellelli A | title = Inhibition of Schistosoma mansoni Thioredoxin-glutathione Reductase by Auranofin: STRUCTURAL AND KINETIC ASPECTS | journal = Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 284 | issue = 42 | pages = 28977–85 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19710012 | pmc = 2781444 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M109.020701 }}</ref>

=====Platinum=====
Along with cisplatin, many other [[platinum]] complexes are potential therapeutics. Like auranofin, terpyridine platinum inhibits thioredoxin reductase<ref name="Wang, A. H.

=====Ruthenium=====
[[Ruthenium]] complexes have anticancer activity. A library of glutathione transferase inhibitors were created through a combination of [[ethacrynic acid]] (a known inhibitor of the enzyme) and ruthenium complexes.<ref name="pmid19396894">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ang WH, Parker LJ, De Luca A, Juillerat-Jeanneret L, Morton CJ, Lo Bello M, Parker MW, Dyson PJ | title = Rational design of an organometallic glutathione transferase inhibitor | journal = Angew.

=====Vanadium=====
[[Vanadium]] complexes have been used in multiple therapeutic settings. A new area in which vanadium may have a great medicinal impact is through the oxovanadium porphyrin complexes. These complexes have demonstrated [[reverse transcriptase|HIV-1 reverse transcriptase]] inhibition in vitro.<ref name="pmid17992273">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sun RW, Ma DL, Wong EL, Che CM | title = Some uses of transition metal complexes as anti-cancer and anti-HIV agents | journal = Dalton Trans | volume = | issue = 43 | pages = 4884–92 |date=November 2007 | pmid = 17992273 | doi = 10.1039/b705079h }}</ref>

====Issues and outlook====
Though there is currently much excitement in the field of metal-based medicines, many challenges still face researchers. One such challenge is selectivity of complexes in vivo. Many of these complexes can bind to common proteins like [[serum albumin]] in addition to other proteins with amino acids that are common in protein–metal complex interactions like histidine, cysteine, and selenocysteine.<ref name="Che, C. M. 2010"/> Along with selectivity issues, much is yet unknown about mechanisms through which metal complexes interact with proteins. How complexing between a given metal complex and target protein or enzyme occurs is often unknown or unclear and requires much more elucidation before truly effective metal complexes can be designed and delivered.<ref name="Che, C. M. 2010"/> Currently, physicians utilize very few metal-based medicines in the clinics. For example, none of the 21 drugs approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 2008 were inorganic.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hughes B | title = 2008 FDA drug approvals | journal = Nature Reviews Drug Discovery | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 93–6 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19180096 | doi = 10.1038/nrd2813 }}</ref> However, with the success of cisplatin in cancer treatment, it is not unreasonable to anticipate more metal complexes will be actively used in the treatment of diseases.

===Synthetic biology===
[[Synthetic biology]] focuses on the manipulation of biological components to form new systems or the generation of living systems with synthetic parts. The canonical idea of synthetic biology is the creation of new life, but recently it has come to include [[bioengineering]] in terms of the use of interchangeable components to give novel outputs. In the search for modular parts, it is most facile if the building blocks contribute independently to the function of the whole unit so that the modules can be recombined in predictable ways.  It is useful for synthetic biologists to define "life": in this context, to be alive an organism must be capable of Darwinian [[evolution]] – genetic mutation, self-replication and inheritance of mutations.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Benner SA, Sismour AM | title = Synthetic biology | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 6 | issue = 7 | pages = 533–43 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15995697 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1637 }}</ref>

====Synthetic cells====
[[J. Craig Venter]]'s group has created the first "synthetic" cell – the first cells to exist with fully synthetic DNA. Venter was able to manipulate the synthetic [[genome]] to dictate the proteins expressed in the organism. Note that these were not fully synthetic cells but that the synthetic DNA was able to take over all metabolic processes necessary for cell survival and proliferation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gibson DG, Glass JI, Lartigue C, Noskov VN, ((Chuang R-Y)), Algire MA, Benders GA, Montague MG, Ma L | title = Creation of a Bacterial Cell Controlled by a Chemically Synthesized Genome | journal = Science | volume = 329 | issue = 5987 | pages = 52–56 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20488990 | doi = 10.1126/science.1190719 |bibcode = 2010Sci...329...52G }}</ref>

====DNA as interchangeable parts====
[[DNA]] is composed of repeating modular units consisting of an anion phosphate group that forms the polyanion backbone, and nucleotide base pairs that engage in Watson-Crick base pairing to form the double strand. Because the molecular recognition of DNA is based mostly on the polyanion backbone, the nucleotides can be modified without altering the structural integrity of the DNA. Steven Benner's group has generated an artificial genetic alphabet of eight new base pairs that can be amplified by [[polymerase chain reaction]]; this indicates that these base pairs can be used in systems that undergo Darwinian evolution.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sismour AM, Lutz S, Park JH, Lutz MJ, Boyer PL, Hughes SH, Benner SA | title = PCR amplification of DNA containing non-standard base pairs by variants of reverse transcriptase from Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 32 | issue = 2 | pages = 728–35 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14757837 | pmc = 373358 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkh241 }}</ref>

====Proteins as interchangeable parts====

=====Amino acids=====
[[Amino acids]] are poor modular building-blocks because they do not act independently and there is a fundamental lack of understanding about the relationship between linear amino acid sequences and the folding and functionality of proteins. Chemical biologists have been able to model, design, and synthesize [[peptides]] and evaluate their function.<ref name="10.1021/ja991266c">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kennan AJ, Haridas V, Severin K, Lee DH, Ghadiri MR | title = A de novo designed peptide ligase: A mechanistic investigation | journal = J. Am. Chem. Soc. | volume = 123 | issue = 9 | pages = 1797–1803 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11456796 | doi = 10.1021/ja991266c }}</ref>

=====Protein secondary structure=====
Modules consisting of protein secondary structure can be designed to perform specific functions; for example, it has been demonstrated that alpha helices can be used as functional peptide [[catalysts]]. The Ghadiri group has created a template peptide that promotes the [[Chemical ligation|ligation]] of two modified helices by bringing the helices into close proximity by specifically designed hydrophobic interactions of the helices with the template.<ref name="10.1021/ja991266c"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Saghatelian A, Yokobayashi Y, Soltani K, Ghadiri MR | title = A chiroselective peptide replicator | journal = Nature | volume = 409 | issue = 6822 | pages = 797–801 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11236988 | doi = 10.1038/35057238 |bibcode = 2001Natur.409..797S }}</ref>

=====Folded proteins=====
Fully folded proteins can be combined in novel ways to generate specific non-natural outcomes. This is highly useful commercially from drug development to the production of [[polymers]] – one can imagine the economic benefits if scientists can design systems in which proteins catalyze reactions without the necessity of excessive human intervention to produce commercially relevant materials. For example, the Keasling group has developed a series of proteins that catalyze conversion of [[acetyl CoA]], a common cellular [[metabolite]], into a precursor for the potent antimalarial drug [[artemisinin]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = ((Martin VJJ)), Pitera DJ, Withers ST, Newman JD, Keasling JD | title = Engineering a mevalonate pathway in Escherichia coli for production of terpenoids | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 21 | issue = 7 | pages = 796–802 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12778056 | doi = 10.1038/nbt833 }}</ref>

====Modifying molecular switches====
Signaling pathways can be modified to be turned on or off by non-natural [[ligands]] or inputs to the system. For instance, systems can be modified so that they are autoinhibited by non-natural proteins that release their inhibition upon binding with a specific molecule that is different from the natural signaling molecule of the path.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Park SH, Zarrinpar A, Lim WA | title = Rewiring MAP kinase pathways using alternative scaffold assembly mechanisms | journal = Science | volume = 299 | issue = 5609 | pages = 1061–1064 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12511654 | doi = 10.1126/science.1076979 |bibcode = 2003Sci...299.1061P }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Prehoda KE, Scott JA, Mullins RD, Lim WA | title = Integration of multiple signals through cooperative regulation of the N-WASP-Arp2/3 complex | journal = Science | volume = 290 | issue = 5492 | pages = 801–806 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11052943 | doi = 10.1126/science.290.5492.801 |bibcode = 2000Sci...290..801P }}</ref> This allows new approaches to studying signal circuits specifically and with user-designed inputs.

===Chemical approaches to stem-cell biology===
{{main article|Stem Cell|Induced stem cells}}
Advances in stem-cell biology have typically been driven by discoveries in [[molecular biology]] and [[genetics]]. These have included optimization of culture conditions for the maintenance and [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]] of [[Cell potency|pluripotent]] and multipotent stem-cells and the deciphering of [[cell signaling|signaling circuits]] that control stem-cell fate. However, chemical approaches to stem-cell biology have recently received increased attention due to the identification of several [[small molecules]] capable of modulating stem-cell fate in vitro.<ref name="pmid17493865">{{cite journal | vauthors = Emre N, Coleman R, Ding S | title = A chemical approach to stem cell biology | journal = Curr Opin Chem Biol | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 252–8 |date=June 2007 | pmid = 17493865 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2007.04.024 }}</ref> A small molecule approach offers particular advantages over traditional methods in that it allows a high degree of temporal control, since compounds can be added or removed at will, and tandem inhibition/activation of multiple cellular targets.

Small molecules that modulate stem-cell behavior are commonly identified in [[high-throughput screening|high-throughput screens]]. Libraries of compounds are screened for the induction of a desired phenotypic change in cultured stem-cells. This is usually observed through activation or repression of a fluorescent reporter or by detection of specific cell surface markers by [[fluorescence-activated cell sorting|FACS]] or [[immunohistochemistry]]. Hits are then structurally optimized for activity by the synthesis and screening of secondary libraries. The cellular targets of the small molecule can then be identified by [[affinity chromatography]], [[mass spectrometry]], or [[DNA microarray]].  
	
A trademark of pluripotent stem-cells, such as [[embryonic stem cell|embryonic stem-cells]] (ESCs), is the ability to [[biological immortality|self-renew]] indefinitely. The conventional use of feeder cells and various exogenous growth factors in the culture of ESCs presents a problem in that the resulting highly variable culture conditions make the long-term expansion of un-differentiated ESCs challenging.<ref name="pmid20714081">{{cite journal | vauthors = Vazin T, Freed WJ | title = Human embryonic stem cells: derivation, culture, and differentiation: a review | journal = Restor.

Neurosci. | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 589–603 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20714081 | pmc = 2973558 | doi = 10.3233/RNN-2010-0543 }}</ref> Ideally, chemically defined culture conditions could be developed to maintain ESCs in a pluripotent state indefinitely. Toward this goal, the Schultz and Ding labs at the [[Scripps Research Institute]] identified a small molecule that can preserve the long-term self-renewal of ESCs in the absence of feeder cells and other exogenous growth factors.<ref name="pmid17088537">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen S, Do JT, Zhang Q, Yao S, Yan F, Peters EC, Schöler HR, Schultz PG, Ding S | title = Self-renewal of embryonic stem cells by a small molecule | journal = Proc.

[[File:Stemcellmodulators.tif|thumb|275px|Small molecule modulators of stem-cell fate.]]
The utility of stem-cells is in their ability to differentiate into all cell types that make up an organism. Differentiation can be achieved in vitro by favoring development toward a particular cell type through the addition of lineage specific growth factors, but this process is typically non-specific and generates low yields of the desired phenotype. Alternatively, inducing differentiation by small molecules is advantageous in that it allows for the development of completely chemically defined conditions for the generation of one specific cell type. A small molecule, neuropathiazol, has been identified which can specifically direct differentiation of multipotent [[neural stem cells]] into [[neurons]].<ref name="pmid16323231">{{cite journal | vauthors = Warashina M, Min KH, Kuwabara T, Huynh A, Gage FH, Schultz PG, Ding S | title = A synthetic small molecule that induces neuronal differentiation of adult hippocampal neural progenitor cells | journal = Angew.

Because of the ethical issues surrounding ESC research, the generation of pluripotent cells by reprogramming existing [[somatic cells]] into a more "stem-like" state is a promising alternative to the use of standard ESCs. By genetic approaches, this has recently been achieved in the creation of ESCs by [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Egli D, Rosains J, Birkhoff G, Eggan K | title = Developmental reprogramming after chromosome transfer into mitotic mouse zygotes | journal = Nature | volume = 447 | issue = 7145 | pages = 679–85 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17554301 | doi = 10.1038/nature05879 |bibcode = 2007Natur.447..679E }}</ref> and the generation of [[induced pluripotent stem cell|induced pluripotent stem-cells]] by viral [[transduction (genetics)|transduction]] of specific genes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Takahashi K, Yamanaka S | title = Induction of Pluripotent Stem Cells from Mouse Embryonic and Adult Fibroblast Cultures by Defined Factors | journal = Cell | volume = 126 | issue = 4 | pages = 663–76 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16904174 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024 }}</ref> From a therapeutic perspective, reprogramming by chemical means would be safer than genetic methods because induced stem-cells would be free of potentially dangerous [[transgenes]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Anastasia L, Pelissero G, Venerando B, Tettamanti G | title = Cell reprogramming: Expectations and challenges for chemistry in stem cell biology and regenerative medicine | journal = Cell Death and Differentiation | volume = 17 | issue = 8 | pages = 1230–7 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20168332 | doi = 10.1038/cdd.2010.14 }}</ref> Several examples of small molecules that can de-differentiate somatic cells have been identified.

Stem-cell therapies are currently the most promising treatment for many [[degenerative diseases]]. Chemical approaches to stem-cell biology support the development of cell-based therapies by enhancing stem-cell growth, maintenance, and differentiation in vitro. Small molecules that have been shown to modulate stem-cell fate are potential therapeutic candidates and provide a natural lean-in to pre-clinical drug development. Small molecule drugs could promote endogenous stem-cells to differentiate, replacing previously damaged tissues and thereby enhancing the body's own [[regenerative medicine|regenerative]] ability. Further investigation of molecules that modulate stem-cell behavior will only unveil new therapeutic targets.

===Fluorescence for assessing protein location and function===

====Fluorophores and techniques to tag proteins====
Organisms are composed of cells that, in turn, are composed of macromolecules, e.g. proteins, ribosomes, etc. These macromolecules interact with each other, changing their concentration and suffering chemical modifications. The main goal of many biologists is to understand these interactions, using [[MRI]], ESR, [[electrochemistry]], and [[fluorescence]] among others. The advantages of fluorescence reside in its high sensitivity, non-invasiveness, safe detection, and ability to modulate the fluorescence signal. Fluorescence was observed mainly from small organic dyes attached to antibodies to the protein of interest. Later, fluorophores could directly recognize organelles, nucleic acids, and important ions in living cells. In the past decade, the discovery of [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP), by [[Roger Y. Tsien]], hybrid system and quantum dots have enable assessing protein location and function more precisely.<ref name="Giepmans, B. N. G. 2006">{{cite journal | vauthors = ((Giepmans BNG)), Adams SR, Ellisman MH, Tsien RY | title = The Fluorescent Toolbox for Assessing Protein Location and Function | journal = Science | volume = 312 | issue = 5771 | pages = 217–224 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16614209 | doi = 10.1126/science.1124618 |bibcode = 2006Sci...312..217G }}</ref> Three main types of fluorophores are used: small organic dyes, green fluorescent proteins, and [[quantum dots]]. Small organic dyes usually are less than 1 kD, and have been modified to increase photostability, enhance brightness, and reduce self-quenching. Quantum dots have very sharp wavelength, high molar absorptivity and quantum yield. Both organic dyes and quantum dyes do not have the ability to recognize the protein of interest without the aid of antibodies, hence they must use [[immunolabeling]]. Since the size of the fluorophore-targeting complex typically exceeds 200 kD, it might interfere with multiprotein recognition in protein complexes, and other methods should be use in parallel.  An advantage includes diversity of properties and a limitation is the ability of targeting in live cells. Green fluorescent proteins are genetically encoded and can be covalently fused to your protein of interest. A more developed genetic tagging technique is the tetracysteine biarsenical system, which requires modification of the targeted sequence that includes four cysteines, which binds membrane-permeable biarsenical molecules, the green and the red dyes "FlAsH" and "ReAsH", with picomolar affinity. Both fluorescent proteins and biarsenical tetracysteine can be expressed in live cells, but present major limitations in ectopic expression and might cause lose of function. Giepmans shows parallel applications of targeting methods and fluorophores using GFP and tetracysteine with ReAsH for α-tubulin and β-actin, respectively. After fixation, cells were immunolabeled for the Golgi matrix with QD and for the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome with Cy5.<ref name="Giepmans, B. N. G. 2006"/>

====Protein dynamics====
Fluorescent techniques have been used assess a number of protein dynamics including protein tracking, conformational changes, protein–protein interactions, protein synthesis and turnover, and enzyme activity, among others.

Three general approaches for measuring protein net redistribution and diffusion are single-particle tracking, [[correlation spectroscopy]] and photomarking methods. In single-particle tracking, the individual molecule must be both bright and sparse enough to be tracked from one video to the other. Correlation spectroscopy analyzes the intensity fluctuations resulting from migration of fluorescent objects into and out of a small volume at the focus of a laser. In photomarking, a fluorescent protein can be dequenched in a subcellular area with the use of intense local illumination and the fate of the marked molecule can be imaged directly. Michalet and coworkers used quantum dots for single-particle tracking using biotin-quantum dots in HeLa cells.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Michalet X, Pinaud FF, Bentolila LA, Tsay JM, Doose S, Li JJ, Sundaresan G, Wu AM, Gambhir SS | title = Quantum Dots for Live Cells, in Vivo Imaging, and Diagnostics | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5709 | pages = 538–544 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15681376 | pmc = 1201471 | doi = 10.1126/science.1104274 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..538M }}</ref>

One of the best ways to detect conformational changes in proteins is to sandwich said protein between two fluorophores. [[Förster resonance energy transfer|FRET]] will respond to internal conformational changes result from reorientation of the fluorophore with respect to the other. Dumbrepatil sandwiched an estrogen receptor between a CFP (cyan fluorescent protein) and a YFP (yellow fluorescent protein) to study conformational changes of the receptor upon binding of a ligand.<ref name="pmid20049819">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dave SR, Gao X | title = Monodisperse magnetic nanoparticles for biodetection, imaging, and drug delivery: a versatile and evolving technology | journal = Wiley Interdiscip Rev Nanomed Nanobiotechnol | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 583–609 | year = 2009 | pmid = 20049819 | doi = 10.1002/wnan.51 }}</ref>

Fluorophores of different colors can be applied to detect their respective antigens within the cell. If antigens are located close enough to each other, they will appear colocalized and this phenomenon is known as [[colocalization]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zinchuk V, Grossenbacher-Zinchuk O | title = Recent advances in quantitative colocalization analysis: Focus on neuroscience | journal = Progress in Histochemistry and Cytochemistry | volume = 44 | issue = 3 | pages = 125–72 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19822255 | doi = 10.1016/j.proghi.2009.03.001 }}</ref> Specialized computer software, such as [[CoLocalizer Pro]], can be used to confirm and characterize the degree of colocalization.

FRET can detect dynamic protein–protein interaction in live cells providing the fluorophores get close enough. Galperin ''et al.'' used three fluorescent proteins to study multiprotein interactions in live cells.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Galperin E, Verkhusha VV, Sorkin A | title = Three-chromophore FRET microscopy to analyze multiprotein interactions in living cells | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 209–17 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15782196 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth720 }}</ref>

Tetracysteine biarsenical systems can be used to study protein synthesis and turnover, which requires discrimination of old copies from new copies. In principle, a tetracysteine-tagged protein is labeled with FlAsH for a short time, leaving green labeled proteins.  The protein synthesis is then carried out in the presence of ReAsH, labeling the new proteins as red.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gaietta G, Deerinck TJ, Adams SR, Bouwer J, Tour O, Laird DW, Sosinsky GE, Tsien RY, Ellisman MH | title = Multicolor and Electron Microscopic Imaging of Connexin Trafficking | journal = Science | volume = 296 | issue = 5567 | pages = 503–507 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11964472 | doi = 10.1126/science.1068793 |bibcode = 2002Sci...296..503G }}</ref>

One can also use fluorescence to see endogenous enzyme activity, typically by using a quenched [[activity based proteomics]] (qABP). Covalent binding of a qABP to the active site of the targeted enzyme will provide direct evidence concerning if the enzyme is responsible for the signal upon release of the quencher and regain of fluorescence.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Terai T, Nagano T | title = Fluorescent probes for bioimaging applications | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 515–21 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18771748 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.08.007 }}</ref>

The unique combination of high spatial and temporal resolution, nondestructive compatibility with living cells and organisms, and molecular specificity insure that fluorescence techniques will remain central in the analysis of protein networks and systems biology.<ref name="Giepmans, B. N. G. 2006"/>

===Applications of DNA microarrays in chemical biology===
{{main article|DNA microarray}}
Planar surfaces functionalized with single- or double-strand nucleic acids have enabled researchers to address a variety of salient biological and biochemical questions in recent years.  The general architecture of modern [[DNA microarray]]s reflects the historical progression from the sequence-specific probing of whole chromosomes immobilized on glass slides (as early as 1961 with [[Fluorescent in situ hybridization|fluorescent ''in situ'' hybridization]]) and the low-density porous membrane arrays available since the early 1990s, to the high-density (10<sup>2</sup>-10<sup>4</sup> features/mm<sup>2</sup>) solid support platforms that exist today.<ref name="Stoughton, R.

DNA microarrays can be used to conduct several general types of experiments, most of which relying on the [[DNA-DNA hybridization|hybridization]] of fluorescently labeled single-strand DNA molecules isolated from a biological sample to their single-strand complement probes presented on an array.  One of the earliest conceived applications for DNA microarrays was for single-nucleotide polymorphism ([[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNP]]) genotyping.  Since SNPs are a "quick and dirty" approach to detect genetic indicators of pathologies and lineages, arrays in theory provide a facile method for diagnosis; this was confirmed experimentally in the late 1990s in the successful SNP analysis of human tumors.<ref name="pmid10377423">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ahrendt SA, Halachmi S, Chow JT, Wu L, Halachmi N, Yang SC, Wehage S, Jen J, Sidransky D | title = Rapid p53 sequence analysis in primary lung cancer using an oligonucleotide probe array | journal = Proc.

High-density DNA microarrays have emerged as an important component of the chemical biology toolkit.  The existing technology allows for the construction of customizable, as well as general, arrays and provides researchers with the opportunity to generate robust data from many different types of biological inputs.  Considering the relatively recent shift in the scientific community away from binary perturbation/readout studies and toward "big science" and large data sets, it seems likely that DNA microarrays will continue to enable pertinent biological research for many years to come.

:- A clickable covalent ''occupancy probe'' of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) has been used to relate target engagement to anandamide elevation and efficacy in models of rodent inflammatory and neuropathic pain.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ahn K ''et al'' | year = 2011 | title = Mechanistic and Pharmacological Characterization of PF-04457845: A Highly Potent and Selective Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase Inhibitor That Reduces Inflammatory and Noninflammatory Pain | journal = J.

A clickable covalent probe of the mRNA decapping enzyme DcpS, which used a sulfonyl fluoride warhead to target a reactive tyrosine in the binding site of the enzyme, enabled the assessment of DcpS target engagement of a diaminoquinazoline inhibitor (developed from a phenotypic screen for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hett EC ''et al'' | year = | title = Rational targeting of active site tyrosine residues using sulfonyl fluoride probes | url = | journal = ACS Chem.
